# Currency in the Distorted Domains

Each domain in Distorted Domains is likely to use a different form of currency. So if players want to trade, they will need something else of value. This can be doing someone a favor, offering information, or trading another object that they have. For short periods of time, players can narrative item that represents the amount of gold or particular item of value. Both of these could be represented as assets if there is no specific goal in mind these can be temporary assets. Or they can simply be a narrative item, meant to be protected until it can be traded for what the players are really after.

### Resources as an Asset

If you would like your players to stay in one domain for an extended campaign, it may make sense for them to acquire currency and other items of value to trade within that domain. You can represent this with a Resources asset, that can go up when they acquire wealth, and goes down when they spend. A character should never be able to purchase something at a higher die rating than their resources asset. If they fail the roll, the resources asset is lowered by 1, but the asset can still be acquired. If the asset being acquired was the same die level as the resources die and the roll failed, then the character will owe a favor or have to give up something else of value in order to gain the asset.
