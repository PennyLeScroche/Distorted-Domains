## Hawking station

A space station orbiting a black hole beyond its event horizon. The layout feels ever shifting and time can move faster or slower depending on what room you're in. The station is occupied by sentient dinosaurs who have no recollection of who built the station or how they got there. In the center there is a circular room with only one doorway, but you never seem to exit in the same place that you entered

control room

## Gastropolis

A city built on the back of a snail-dragon floating through the cosmos

## The wild remains

Badlands with settlements built around the ruins of ancient civilizations and the bones of fallen monsters
