### The Smoldering Caves

At the edge of the swamp, is the mouth of a cave that goes into the side of an unfathomably high mountain. The side of the mountain is sheer and impossible to climb. The water in the cave is less acidic, and it's home to a number of bioluminescent fungi. Deep in the caves are vents that release a mineral rich smoke, heating the cave and providing nutrients to the life within it, but making it hard to breathe for those that aren't adapted
