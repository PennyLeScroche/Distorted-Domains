title: Hawking Station
---
A space station orbiting a black hole beyond its event horizon. The layout feels ever shifting and time can move faster or slower depending on what room you're in. The station is occupied by sentient dinosaurs who have no recollection of who built the station or how they got there. In the center there is a circular room with only one doorway, but you never seem to exit in the same place that you entered.

Some Dinosaurs(and other ancient animals):

- Microraptors
- Kosmoceratops
- Appatasaurus
- Parasaurolophus
- Ankylosaur
- Dimetrodon
- Aquilops
- Pterodactyl
- Plesiosaur
- Spinosaurus
- Ichthyosaur

Some Rooms or aspects of the station:

- Dining hall
- Kitchen
- Temple
- Food Production

Some problems:

- A vital system is malfunctioning

- Someone has gone missing
- Someone is hiding something unusual
- Something new has shown up unexpectedly
