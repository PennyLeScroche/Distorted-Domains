Wanda: Yes, she seems to be quite elusive.
Off-screen voice: You Lookin for Someone?

Wanda: Did you see a mushroom woman who passed through here?
Mime: Maybe I did, Maybe I didn't. Maybe you should help me refresh my memory
Ko: You can talk?
Mime: Of course I can, I'm off the clock. 
Wanda: She was about this tall and...
Mime: That's nice, hon, but that's not what I meant. You want something from me, you gotta play ball

Ko: Play ball *how* exactly?
Mime: You want something I have, you need to give me something I want
Wanda: While we would very much like to help, this issue is rather important. Could we convince you to lend us the information on credit?
