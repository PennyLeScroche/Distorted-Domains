# Example of Play #1

Scenario: Ko and Wanda are negotiating a trade in Gastropolis. A street mime has potential information, but will not give it up freely. 

Panel 1
Ko: Where the hell did she go?
Wanda: Yes, she seems to be quite elusive.
Off-screen voice: You Lookin for Someone?

2
Wanda: Did you see a mushroom woman who passed through here?
Mime: Maybe I did, Maybe I didn't. Maybe you should help me refresh my memory
Ko: You can talk?
Mime: Of course I can, I'm off the clock. 
Wanda: She was about this tall and...
Mime: That's nice, hon, but that's not what I meant. You want something from me, you gotta play ball
3
Ko: Play ball *how* exactly?
Mime: You want something I have, you need to give me something I want
Wanda: While we would very much like to help, this issue is rather important. Could we convince you to lend us the information on credit?
[Wanda Rolls Skilled d8 + Cryptid from the deep d6 for using cryptid wiles to make a deal, resulting in a 5 on both. The DM rolls a d4 for Wanda's Skilled harm, and a d6 for the mime. This results in success with a complication. Wanda increases her Skilled harm to a d6, and gains an inspiration for taking on harm]
Mime: Interesting proposal, so I give you the info now, and you owe me a favor I can call in whenever?
Wanda: Uhh... yes I suppose that is what I'm proposing
Ko: Are you sure about this?
Mime: Too late bud, a deal is a deal.
Wanda: Very well
Mime: The lady went that way, and she was in a real hurry. I gotta feeling that she doesn't want to be found.
Wanda: Yes, that does seem to be the case. Thank you very much kind stranger.
