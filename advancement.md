# Inspiration and Advancement

Inspiration and Advancement are two sides of the same coin in Distorted Domains. Inspiration serves as the games metacurrency, and advancement as its way to enhance characters. 

### Inspiration

#### Gaining Inspiration

Inspiration is gained from
- Taking harm
- Helping an ally recover from harm
- Rolls that use a negative aspect

#### Using Inspiration

You start each session with 1 inspiration. 

Before a roll, you can use a point of inspiration to raise a die in your pool, or lower a die in the opposing pool. You can spend multiple points and do this multiple times if you want.

After a roll, you can change a mixed success into a full success. On a failure, you can change what kind of negative outcome you have. You can switch the harm track affected from the one you rolled with to a different one of your choosing. Instead of taking harm to a harm track you can spend an inspiration to take on or step up a negative trait. Both of these options stop you from being incapcitated on a failure

### Advancement

Advancement points are used to enhance your character, and can be gained in a few ways.

points are gained by:
- Having leftover inspiration at the end of a session
- Working toward your individual goals
- Accomplishing something major in an adventure

Things you can do with your advancement points
- Raise a stat die
- Raise an aspect die
- Create a new aspect
- Lower a negative aspect

raising a die to a higher level requires more advancement points the higher you want it to go
