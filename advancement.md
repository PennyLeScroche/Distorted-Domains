# Inspiration and Advancement

Inspiration and Advancement are two sides of the same coin in Distorted Domains. Inspiration serves as the games metacurrency, and advancement as its way to enhance characters. 

### Inspiration

#### Gaining Inspiration

Inspiration is gained from
- Taking harm
- Helping an ally recover from harm
- Rolls that use a negative aspect
- As a possible bonus from a critical success

Gaining inspiration always takes place after a roll, so you cannot use the inspiration you gain from using a negative aspect in that same roll.

#### Using Inspiration

You start each session with 1 inspiration. 

Before a roll, you can use a point of inspiration to raise a die in your pool,use a die you cannot normally use in your pool, or lower a die in the opposing pool. You can spend multiple points and do this multiple times if you want.

After a roll, you can change what kind of negative outcome you have. You can switch the harm track affected from the one you rolled with to a different one of your choosing. Instead of taking harm to a harm track you can spend an inspiration to take on or step up a negative trait. Both of these options stop you from being incapcitated on a failure

Outside of a roll, an inspiration can be spent to make a d6 scene asset without using a roll, or to keep a scene asset for the entire session or adventure. The scene asset created should be something that the character could make with their current abilities, or something that makes sense to be found in that location.

### Advancement

#### Gaining Advancement

Advancement points are used to enhance your character, and can be gained in a few ways.

points are gained by:
- Having leftover inspiration at the end of a session
- Working toward your individual goals
- Finishing an adventure

Use the table below to grant advancement based on the length of the adventure

1 Session | 2-3 Sessions | 4-6 Sessions | 7+ Sessions
:-------: | :----------: | :----------: | :---------:
5         | 10           | 15           | 20


Travelers have a goal, they are looking for something. If a traveler finds that thing, they gain 20 advancement. However, if a player wants to continue on with that same character, they must be given a new goal of some kind, a reason to keep going. The easiest way to do this is to re-roll on the "Looking for" table in character creation. This new goal starts at a d6.


Things you can do with your advancement points
- Raise a stat die
- Raise an aspect die
- Create a new aspect
- Lower a negative aspect

raising a die to a higher level requires more advancement points the higher you want it to go
