# Introduction

I'm making this game with the goal of being able to play across a variety of genres with a simple resolution system that utilizes opposed mixed dice pools. Major inspirations include Cortex Prime from Cam Banks and the team at Direwolf, GROK?! by Lester Burton, TROIKA!, Primal Quest, and the various works of Chuck Tingle. It has undergone many changes and will continue to change as the game is playtested and feedback is integrated.

Distorted Domains is still under development and is not currently in a playable state, but you can choose to use what is there to inspire your own games if you wish.

Distorted Domains uses the CC-BY-SA-4.0 license. Use the game howevever you like. Hack it, extend it, make content for it. Just so long as you give proper attribution and share your derived work with an open license as well.
