# Introduction

I'm this game with the goal of being able to play across a variety of genres with a simple resolution system that utilizes opposed mixed dice pools. Major inspirations include Cortex Prime from Cam Banks and the team at Direwolf, GROK?! by Lester Burton, and the short film Kung Fury. It has undergone many changes and will continue to change as the game is playtested and feedback is integrated.
