title: Distorted Domains

# Introduction

I'm making this game with the goal of being able to play across a variety of genres with a simple resolution system that utilizes opposed mixed dice pools. Major inspirations include Cortex Prime from Cam Banks and the team at Direwolf, GROK?! by Lester Burton, TROIKA!, Primal Quest, Doctor Who, Numenara, and the various works of Chuck Tingle. It has undergone many changes and will continue to change as the game is playtested and feedback is integrated.

This game is meant to be weird and silly. The characters are meant to feel powerful, but also goofy. Who you are, what your experiences are, what you're looking for, and why you're looking for it will all play a factor in how characters accomplish their goals. While death is a possibility in Distorted Domains, it will focus more on long term consequences when things get bad. It features an anti-canon setting that allows you to mash up all of your favorite things without worrying what would make sense.

Distorted Domains is still under development and is undergoing playtesting, but you can play this early version of the game or use what is there as inspiration for your own games.

I have also made a [Google Sheets Character Keeper](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iD2N3VkBVdb9CuRejHPc5lP251gvXEScqiSs3g6OBUU/edit?usp=sharing) to use for playtesting the game. It will be updated as the game changes, but I can't guarantee that changes to the game will be reflected on the character keeper right away.
