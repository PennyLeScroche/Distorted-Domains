# Introduction

I'm making this game with the goal of being able to play across a variety of genres with a simple resolution system that utilizes opposed mixed dice pools. Major inspirations include Cortex Prime from Cam Banks and the team at Direwolf, GROK?! by Lester Burton, TROIKA!, Primal Quest, and the various works of Chuck Tingle. It has undergone many changes and will continue to change as the game is playtested and feedback is integrated.

Distorted Domains is still under development and is undergoing playtesting, but you can play this early version of the game or use what is there as inspiration for your own games.

I have also made a [Google Sheets Character Keeper](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iD2N3VkBVdb9CuRejHPc5lP251gvXEScqiSs3g6OBUU/edit?usp=sharing) to use for playtesting the game. It will be updated as the game changes, but I can't guarantee that changes to the game will be reflected on the character keeper right away.

Distorted Domains uses the CC-BY-SA-4.0 license. Use the game howevever you like. Hack it, extend it, make content for it. Just so long as you give proper attribution and share your derived work with an open license as well.
