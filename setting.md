# Distorted Domains

Distorted domains is an anti-canon setting where anything goes. The central idea is that you can fuse elements from any of your favorite settings or setting styles and create a "Domain" to adventure in.
Domains could be something like the underwater city run by the Orca mafia, a floating dinosaur village in Jupiter's upper atmosphere, or the Cavern of the singing Crystal sages. 
There will be example domains as well as spark tables to create your own domains and adventures.

Spark Table:

D6  | Thingy   | Place  | of  | People

1   | Floating | Castle | of  | Intelligent Insects
2   | Flying   | Island | of  | Dinosaurs
3   | Mechanical | Restaurant | of | Robots
4   | Underwater | City | of | Orcas
5   | Crystalline | Cave | of | Monks
6   | Neon     | Ship   | of  | Cephalopods
