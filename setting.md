# Distorted Domains

Distorted domains is an anti-canon setting where anything goes. The central idea is that you can fuse elements from any of your favorite settings or setting styles and create a "Domain" to adventure in.
Domains could be something like the underwater city run by the Orca mafia, a floating dinosaur village in Jupiter's upper atmosphere, or the Cavern of the singing Crystal sages. 
There will be example domains as well as spark tables to create your own domains and adventures.

## Domains

### [The Spire](https://pennylescroche.github.io/Distorted-Domains/setting/the-spire)

A glowing crystal tower that rises to the skies from the ocean floor. The water around it turns to vapor. At the bottom is a thriving city full of aquatic mammals run by the orca mafia. Inside lies only mystery.


### [Hawking Station](https://pennylescroche.github.io/Distorted-Domains/setting/hawking-station)

A space station orbiting a black hole beyond its event horizon. The layout feels ever shifting and time can move faster or slower depending on what room you're in. The station is occupied by sentient dinosaurs who have no recollection of who built the station or how they got there.

### [Murky Mire](https://pennylescroche.github.io/Distorted-Domains/setting/murky-mire)

A village in an acidic swamp with carnivorous trees. People mostly live in huts raised above the deadly water. The wildlife is large and dangerous. You will see giant insects, amphibians, and reptiles that the denizens have learned to avoid or live along side of.

### [Gastropolis](https://pennylescroche.github.io/Distorted-Domains/setting/gastropolis)

A civilization living on the shell of a snail dragon traversing the cosmos

### [The wild remains](https://pennylescroche.github.io/Distorted-Domains/setting/wild-remains)

Badlands with settlements built around the ruins of ancient civilizations and the bones of fallen monsters

## Collaborative Domain Creation

If your group likes, you can build a domain to play in together. First get a word or phrase from each player at the table, including the GM. This could be anything, like "demons", "gold", "weird west", "clouds", or "evil". Try arranging the words in different ways until the group comes to a consensus on what their favorite arrangement is. That's the start of your domain. From here, go around the table and have everyone suggest locations, npcs, factions, environment details, and wildlife. Do this until you have a few examples for each category. To flesh out the setting further, connect these details in ways that the group thinks make sense. Putting certain NPCs with specific factions, putting points of interest and specific environment details in specific locations and the like.

At this point, you have a fairly detailed setting. You can stop here, or you can have players suggest adventure prompts based on what you have. Maybe two factions are fighting over resources or a location, maybe there's something mysterious going on in a given location, maybe a specific NPC has been acting weird lately, perhaps there are rumours related to unusual wildlife in an area.
