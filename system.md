# Distortion Dice

### Overview

The system of Distorted Domains is tentatively called Distortion Dice. It's a simple system. Characters have 3 stats, and an opposing harm track for each stat. Characters also have a number of aspects and assets. aspects can be things like background details and personality traits, and they can be positive or negative. Assets are physical things that characters carry with them, and can only be used positively. While characters can use all relevant aspects, assets are limited by how many a character can logically use at one time. You wouldn't expect your character to be able to use a lasso and a chainsaw at the same time, for example.

### Taking Action

When your character would like to do something where failure would be interesting you make a roll. To do so, two dice pools are assembled, one player pool, and one opposition pool. For the player pool, we start with the most relevant stat for the action or approach taking place. Then the player may add the dice for any appropriate positive traits. Next, the player may select an appropriate number of assets and add the dice from those to the pool.

For the opposition pool, the narrator will first select the harm die that matches the players stat. If a player is using strong, the narrator will use the die from that players Strong harm track. Any negative traits that the character has that are appropriate can also be added to the opposition pool. Last the narrator will add dice based on what the opposing force is. If it is an NPC, it will likely have a base die rating and some traits with die ratings as well. If is a static object, a base rating can be determined by the narrator if it is not explictly set in advance.
