# Distortion Dice

### Overview

The system of Distorted Domains is tentatively called Distortion Dice. It's a simple system. Characters have 3 stats, and an opposing harm track for each stat. Characters also have a number of aspects and assets. aspects can be things like background details and personality traits, and they can be positive or negative. Assets are physical things that characters carry with them, and can only be used positively. While characters can use all relevant aspects, assets are limited by how many a character can logically use at one time. You wouldn't expect your character to be able to use a lasso and a chainsaw at the same time, for example.

### Taking Action

When your character would like to do something where failure would be interesting you make a roll. To do so, two dice pools are assembled, one player pool, and one opposition pool. For the player pool, we start with the most relevant stat for the action or approach taking place. Then the player may add the dice for any appropriate positive traits. Next, the player may select an appropriate number of assets and add the dice from those to the pool.

For the opposition pool, the narrator will first select the harm die that matches the players stat. If a player is using strong, the narrator will use the die from that players Strong harm track. Any negative traits that the character has that are appropriate can also be added to the opposition pool. Last the narrator will add dice based on what the opposing force is. If it is an NPC, it will likely have a base die rating and some aspects with die ratings as well. If is a static object, a base rating can be determined by the narrator if it is not explictly set in advance. 

Once pools are rolled, you simply compare the highest die from your pool to the highest die of the opposition pool.

If you beat the opposition you succeed at what you were trying to do. If you beat the opposition by 5 or more, you get a critical success and gain a bonus of some kind. If you tie with the opposition, you succeed at a cost. And if your die is lower than the opposition you fail and something bad happens. The critical success bonus will vary depending on the situation. If you are trying to cause harm to an NPC you will cause an extra harm, if you are accomplishing a task perhaps you do it particularly well or get a bonus of some kind.

### Taking Harm

When an action results in a mixed success or a failure, raise a harm die to the next die level. The harm die raised will be the one from the harm track that matches the stat being rolled. If a harm die would be raised above a d12, then your character is incapaciated and can no longer take action until the next scene. In addition, they take on or raise a negative aspect. If a negative aspect is raised above a d12, your character is retired.

### Pushing your luck

In situations that are dire, you can push yourself for a greater chance at success. Before you roll, you can choose to take the harm die away from the opposition and use it in your own pool, However, after the roll you must raise the harm die to the next die size, from d6 to d8 for example.

### Reducing Harm

Taking a few moments to rest allows your character to reduce a harm die by one die size. This costs you some time, but depending on the situation, this can have negative consequences, and in dire situations may not be an option at all. Each day, you can do this once for each harm track.

You can also reduce the harm die by taking an action to do so, but this requires a roll. If you are reducing your own harm die, the opposition pool will use the harm die twice. If you are reducing another characters harm die, the opposition pool will use their harm die as well as your own. The narrator can also add in any relevant die for the situation at hand to the opposition pool. On a success reduce the harm die by one, on a critical success reduce it by two, on a mixed success you can reduce the target harm die by one, but you must also raise the die of a different harm track, on a fail you make it worse and raise the harm die by one.

If you stop to rest for an extended period of time, such as overnight, you can reduce each harm track by one. At the end of an adventure, you can reduce all harm tracks to d4.

### Harm for NPCs

NPCs do not have a harm track. If the NPC has stats, their stats get lowered as they take harm, if the NPC does not have stats, they will likely just have one die rating that will get lowered as they take harm. If they take harm at a d4, then the NPC is incapacitated, or otherwise loses the engagement and the PCs get what they want.
